        Crafted by nature. Inspired by community.

        Willow & Wild was founded by Siobhan and Aisling — two friends who share a deep love for slow living,
        local heritage, and sustainable craftsmanship. From fragrant wild herbs to locally spun wool, every
        product we offer is thoughtfully made and ethically sourced right here in the South of Ireland.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed font-sans text-moss mt-6">
        We believe in the power of place, people, and purpose — and we hope to share that with every candle lit,
        every sip of tea, and every gift wrapped with love.
